## Makeover Monday

Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development appointment with yourself and hundreds of passionate data people from around the globe. Free of charge!
Every Monday a new data set is released to create better, more effective visualizations and help us make information more accessible.

## Personal Youtube Viewing

This is a project illustrating my personal viewing time watching the popular tabletop RPG series Critical Role, spanning a period of months.
